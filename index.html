	<h1>Welcome to my personal blogging site.</h1>
	This site features my hobbies and skills from both my personal gaming career and my professional technical career.  I will be posting some technical coding that I have created over the years that I have found useful for learning and to help with progress in my applications and scripts. I will also be posting about my gaming achievements when I feel they are good enough to share with my peers... this is not a frequent occurrence.
	<h2>Technical Background</h2>
	I graduated as an Internet Security Specialist from CDI aka Everest College in Ontario, Canada.  Since my graduation, I have been working for an OEM manufacturer as a Data Analysts and Security Specialist. While studying for school and working in my field I have had to learn a lot of different coding languages to help make my day to day duties more efficient. Some of these languages are listed below;
	<ul>
		<li>Python</li>
		<li>Visual Basic</li>
		<li>Visual C++</li>
		<li>PHP</li>
		<li>Java</li>
	</ul>
	Some languages that I am trying to learn and would love to spend more time on are the following;
	<ul>
		<li>Ruby</li>
		<li>Swift</li>
		<li>Object-C</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Gaming</h2>
	I have been gaming since I was about 5 years old, my first console was an Atari 7800 and an NES, not sure which actually came first.
