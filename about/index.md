## Welcome to my personal blogging site

This site features my hobbies and skills from both my personal gaming career and my professional technical career.  I will be posting some technical coding that I have created over the years that I have found useful for learning and to help with progress in my applications and scripts. I will also be posting about my gaming achievements when I feel they are good enough to share with my peersâ€¦ this is not a frequent occurrence.
Technical Background

I graduated as an Internet Security Specialist from CDI aka Everest College in Ontario, Canada.  Since my graduation, I have been working for an OEM manufacturer as a Data Analysts and Security Specialist. While studying for school and working in my field I have had to learn a lot of different coding languages to help make my day to day duties more efficient. Some of these languages are listed below;

    Python
    Visual Basic
    Visual C++
    PHP
    Java

Some languages that I am trying to learn and would love to spend more time on are the following;

    Ruby
    Swift
    Object-C

Gaming

I have been gaming since I was about 5 years old, my first console was an Atari 7800 and an NES, not sure which actually came first.
